# **Stock Price Prediction**

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical stock market data to train predictive models that forecast future price movements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from nseindia.com, which includes historical stock prices and relevant features such as volume, opening price, closing price, etc.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw dataset, including handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, relative strength index) and sentiment analysis from news articles.
- Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
- Training the Models: Train the selected models using the training dataset and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
- Testing the Models: Test the trained models on the testing dataset to assess their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting stock prices.

## Results
* Linear Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 70%.
* Decision Trees: Accuracy of 75%.
* LSTM: Accuracy of 85%.
